This is chessbot I wrote from scratch for fun. Its not yet very good (I still have lots of things to implement), but can be quite tricky for a beginner (such as me) to beat.

Thanks to the [chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page) for all the useful information.

You can challenge me on [lichess](https://lichess.org/@/Greg0lord-BOT) if I'm online.
